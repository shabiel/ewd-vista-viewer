# Introduction
This is Nikolay Topalov's execllent VistA Viewer application. It allows you to do the following:

 * View the data dictionary for each file and field.
 * View and TEST Remote Procedure Calls
 * View Routines
 * View Options, Security Keys, and Parameter Defintions
 * View Patches and their components.

I (Sam Habiel) ported the application from the original code on https://github.com/nikolaytopalov/VistAViewer3/ to
run under the Panorama Framework.

# Installation
To install, in the qewd folder type `npm install ewd-vista-viewer`. Due to the fact that the application
lets you run RPCs, you must have XUPROG to access the application.
